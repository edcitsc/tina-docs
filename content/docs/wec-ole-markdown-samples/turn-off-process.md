# Turn Off Process

## Applies To

- Utilities: MERC, MGU, NSG, PGL, WPS, WE
- Audience: Business Solutions Center, Contact Center

## Description

A Turn Off order is issued to obtain a final reading to end service and billing for a customer. We cannot deny a Turn Off request from the customer of record.

Turn Off orders are issued for the following reasons:

- Turn off to seal the meters.
- Turn off for tenants with an owner agreement.
- Service reverts to the landlord.
- Service is locked.
- Turn off for owner selling a home.

> Note: Turn On orders automatically create a succession Turn Off order.

> Note: If customer mentions the customer of record is deceased, refer to [Customer of Record is Deceased](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Customer-of-Record-is-Deceased.aspx).

> Note: MERC, MGU, NSG, PGL, and WPS only: There is no limit to the number of accounts that can be handled on a call. It is the goal to resolve all customer inquiries during the first contact. However, if the customer has six or more [Turn On](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/OleV2-Index.aspx?guid=fedc1c66-d29c-4f51-b3b7-9a8d93d941ff&pn=Start%20Service) or [Turn Off](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Turn%20Off.aspx) requests, advise the customer that the process time for the requests will be lengthy. Offer the option of using the company's website or e-mail. Refer to [Handle Multiple Accounts](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Handle-Multiple-Accounts.aspx).

> Note: WE only: The Small Business Center handles situations such as sale or purchase of apartment buildings with six or more units, major owner-agreement changes, and stop/start orders involving sale of property with six or more units when the caller has new owner information.

## FAQs

**If Wanted Date for an in-progress Turn Off/On is changed to a date more than 2 days from the Wanted Date, will the status change to pending?**

No. The status remains in progress and the field order reissues when it is within 2 days of the new Wanted Date.

> Important: Re-print the field order to notify the field team of the date change.

**What does it mean when a service has a status of Inactive on a Turn Off order?**

Inactive means the service is still available for use, is not locked, and is not being billed to anyone.

Examples:

- A Turn Off was issued and completed without a Turn On.
- A Turn Off was issued to lock the meters, but Lock was not selected.

**Can a Turn Off be requested by anyone other than the customer of record?**

Yes. A Turn Off can be requested by the customer of record, authorized spouse responsible on the bill (Y, Y), authorized party per customer notification (Y, Y), or a requester with Power of Attorney or domiciliary papers. Refer to [Customer Confidentiality - Related Contract Customer](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/customer-confidentiality.aspx).

**(WE/WPS only) If the electric meter is RSS enabled, what time on the Turn Off order Wanted Date is the meter turned off through RSS when a Turn On order does not exist?**

If RSS Turn Off is enabled:

- The meter is turned off at 5 p.m. on the Wanted Date.
- If the order is issued after 5 p.m. for a same-day Turn Off, the meter is turned off when the order is issued.

## Process

### MERC/MGU

> Note: If customers request the status of a scheduled appointment or missed appointment, refer to [Verify Appointment Status](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Verify-Appointment-Status.aspx).

#### Step 1 {#merc-mgu-step-1}

Access the account and confirm the request can be handled as a standard Turn Off.

  1. [Locate a Contract](./locate-a-contract.md).
  2. Verify the caller is authorized. Refer to [Verification Guidelines](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/verification-guidelines.aspx).
  3. If the customer is requesting demolition or tear-down service, refer to [Demolition](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Demolition-MERC-and-MGU.aspx).

      > Note: Demolition requires meter removal and securing gas service to the main.

  4. If not NSI trained, transfer the call to the MERC NSI or MGU NSI directory or speed dial.
  5. Verify whether the account is on Large Volume Gas Transportation (LVGT) by viewing the Transportation Status Type attribute on the Contract Overview window or the Offering field on the Services tab.
  6. If LVGT, transfer the call to the [Account Manager](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Managed-Accounts.aspx) and exit the procedure.
  7. If not LVGT, continue.

#### Step 2 {#merc-mgu-step-2}

Review special handling items.

- If the property is in foreclosure or there is mention of a Sheriff's Sale, refer to [Foreclosure Information](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/foreclosure-information.aspx).
- If the account is on [Summary Billing](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Summary-Billing.aspx), remove member contracts from the group and update the mailing address through Quick Launch during the Turn Off order.

#### Step 3 {#merc-mgu-step-3}

Determine whether there is an owner agreement at the premise.

1. [Locate an Owner Agreement](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Locate-an-Owner-Agreement.aspx).
2. Ask whether the caller owned or rented the property.
3. If an owner agreement exists:
    - View the owner agreement and verify the information is correct.
    - If the requester is a renter, ask who they are renting from.
    - If the owner-agreement information or premise contact is incorrect, continue to [Step 4](#merc-mgu-step-4).
    - If the owner-agreement information is correct, check [Owner Agreement Rules](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/owner-agreement-rules.aspx) to verify whether the landlord must be contacted, then continue to [Step 5](#merc-mgu-step-5).
    - If the requester is the owner and is selling the property, [delete the owner agreement](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Delete-an-Owner-Agreement.aspx), then continue to [Step 4](#merc-mgu-step-4).
    - If the requester is the owner and the property will continue as a rental, confirm the owner agreement information is accurate, then continue to [Step 5](#merc-mgu-step-5).
    - If the information is correct and the current owner will occupy the property, delete the owner agreement and continue to [Step 4](#merc-mgu-step-4) to document the owner's information.
4. If no owner agreement exists, continue to [Step 4](#merc-mgu-step-4).

#### Step 4 {#merc-mgu-step-4}

Determine who will be responsible for service.

1. Ask for landlord or new owner information.
2. [Add or Update Landlord Information](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Add-or-Update-Landlord-Information.aspx) to document the details obtained.

#### Step 5 {#merc-mgu-step-5}

Determine whether an in-progress Turn On order exists.

- If a Turn On is scheduled after the requested Turn Off date and is more than 2 days from the current date, proceed to [Step 6](#merc-mgu-step-6).
- If a Turn On is scheduled after the requested Turn Off date and is within 2 days of the current date:
    - Advise the customer that a Turn On is already scheduled for the date and the account will be closed.
    - Enter the customer's final bill address. Refer to [Add a Mailing Address](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Add-a-Mailing-Address.aspx).
    - Add a [Contract Note](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Add-a-Note.aspx):
        - Type: Order
        - Sub type: ON/OFF
        - New Remarks: Customer requested Turn Off. Advise of pending Turn On and forced off date.
    - Proceed to [Step 9](#merc-mgu-step-9).
- If a Turn On is scheduled before the requested Turn Off date:
    - Do not issue the Turn Off order. The Turn Off will be completed with the Turn On.
    - Enter the customer's final bill address. If an owner agreement was deleted, add the mailing address at the contract level.
    - Add a contract note with the pending Turn On and forced off details.
    - Proceed to [Step 9](#merc-mgu-step-9).
- If no Turn On order exists, proceed to [Step 6](#merc-mgu-step-6).

#### Step 6 {#merc-mgu-step-6}

Determine whether the meter needs to be sealed or remain sealed.

- If meter lock or seal is required and there is no Turn On pending, or the Turn On is more than 2 days after the requested Turn Off date:
    - Discuss all [Seal Meter Precautions and Rules](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Seal-Meter-Documentation.aspx).
    - Advise: "Please be aware that if no one calls in for service before your scheduled move out, the meter will be locked and there is a possibility of the pipes freezing. Will the home be winterized?"

> Note: If the requester cannot determine the exact winterization precautions for the dwelling, suggest they contact a plumber.

    - Inform the customer about [charges for reconnect](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/charges-for-specific-services.aspx) and back billing of customer service charges if service is reconnected in the same name within one year of the seal date.
    - Add a [Note](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/add-a-note.aspx) with [Seal Meter Documentation](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/seal-meter-documentation.aspx).
    - Check the Permanent checkbox.
    - Proceed to [Step 7](#merc-mgu-step-7).
- If meter lock or seal is not required because an active owner agreement will revert service to the owner, proceed to [Step 7](#merc-mgu-step-7).
- If the meter is already locked due to NPSO:
    - Proceed to [Step 7](#merc-mgu-step-7).
    - Completion Method: Complete Now w/o Dispatch.
    - Then proceed to [Step 9](#merc-mgu-step-9).
- If the meter is locked because of a structure fire:
    - Review order history completion remarks to determine whether a gas emergency order exists and the meter is locked.
    - If confirmed, refer to [Backdated Turn Off or Turn On](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Backdated-Turn-On-or-Turn-Off.aspx).
    - If not confirmed, contact a leader or Chat SR to verify meter status and determine the turn off date.
    - If still not confirmed, proceed to [Step 7](#merc-mgu-step-7).

    - If Completion Method defaults to Auto Complete, determine [Soft Close](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/soft-close.aspx) eligibility.
    - If Soft Close eligible, advise the customer that the account can be closed with an estimated final reading and later adjusted when an actual reading is obtained.
    - If the order should not be soft closed, select Appointment.
    - If the premise has an owner agreement and one of the last two readings is Itron Reading, select Appointment for a day appointment.
7. Schedule the order if needed.
8. Update the Contact tab:
    - Requested By
    - Contact Phone
    - If scheduling, ask for the number where the service person may reach the customer on the day of the appointment.

    - Add final-bill address and contract note.
    - AMR/AMI only: if the customer does not agree, add Billing Error documentation and a Billing-Res-General note follow-up.
    - Proceed to [Step 9](#we-wps-res-step-9).
- If the Turn On is before the requested Turn Off date:
    - Do not issue the Turn Off.
    - Enter final-bill address and note.
    - Proceed to [Step 9](#we-wps-res-step-9).
- If no Turn On order exists, proceed to [Step 6](#we-wps-res-step-6).

##### Step 6 {#we-wps-res-step-6}

Determine whether the meter needs to be sealed, remain sealed, or remain unlocked.

- April 16 to October 31, RSS electric meter, no revert owner agreement, and no same-day pending Turn On:
    - Meter will lock after 5 p.m. on the Wanted Date.
    - Advise the RSS disclaimer.
    - Check Lock.
    - Proceed to [Step 7](#we-wps-res-step-7).
- April 16 to October 31, non-RSS meter, revert owner agreement, or same-day pending Turn On:
    - Meter will not be locked.
    - Exception: if the owner strongly insists, honor the request.
    - Proceed to [Step 7](#we-wps-res-step-7).
- November 1 to April 15:
    - Meters are not locked between tenants unless the owner strongly insists.
    - Meters are sealed Monday through Friday only, not weekends or holidays.
    - Discuss [Seal Meter Precautions and Rules](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Seal-Meter-Documentation.aspx).
    - Access is needed to verify vacancy.
    - Add a note with seal-meter documentation.
    - Check Permanent.
    - Proceed to [Step 7](#we-wps-res-step-7).
- If lock is not requested:
    - Determine whether an in-progress NPSO order exists.
    - If yes and a landlord Turn On is within five calendar days, cancel or stop the NPSO as appropriate for WE, WPS, or RSS.
    - If no, proceed to [Step 7](#we-wps-res-step-7).
- If already locked due to NPSO, proceed to [Step 7](#we-wps-res-step-7) with Completion Method Complete Now w/o Dispatch, then [Step 9](#we-wps-res-step-9).
- If locked due to structure fire, verify with local office or support and handle as backdated if confirmed.
- If the account is finalled and the owner requests lock, issue a Lock Meter order and coordinate any needed appointment with the local office, then exit.

##### Step 7 {#we-wps-res-step-7}

Issue the Turn Off order.

1. On Orders, select Issue Turn Off.
2. Confirm Order Category, Order Type, and Reason, then Apply.
3. On Services:
    - Check Lock only when meter locking or sealing is required.
    - If there is an owner agreement at the premise, leave Lock unchecked.
    - If one service is already locked and another is active, two orders may be needed.
4. On Scheduling:
    - Enter the requested Turn Off date for each service type.
    - If backdated, refer to [Backdated Turn Off or Turn On](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Backdated-Turn-On-or-Turn-Off.aspx).
5. Let Completion Method default.
    - If already sealed in the field, select Complete Now Without Dispatch and enter the no-dispatch instruction.
    - WE only: use [Meter Locations](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Meter-Locations.aspx) to determine accessibility and choose Normal Completion or Appointment accordingly.
    - If locking due to safety concern, owner request, or company error, use Appointment for WE and Normal Completion for WPS.
6. Schedule an order when required.
    - WE only: use a 4-hour appointment window.
    - WPS only: use a 2-hour window and coordinate with the local office.
7. Advise the customer:
    - Field visit only: secure pets and ensure a clear path.
    - Auto Complete only: service can be completed without a visit.
    - RSS only: service may be automatically disconnected at 5 p.m. on the requested date.
8. Update Contact and Instructions.
