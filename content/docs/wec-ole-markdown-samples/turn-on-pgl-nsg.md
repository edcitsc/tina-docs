## Description

Turn On is issued to initiate billing for a customer.

> Note: If customer of record or third party requests to put service in the name of a revocable trust or irrevocable trust, refer to [Customer Confidentiality](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Customer-Confidentiality.aspx).

> Note: If customer mentions the customer of record is deceased, refer to [Customer of Record is Deceased](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Customer-of-Record-is-Deceased.aspx).

> Note: If the Gas On tab indicates meter is inactive and not locked, but Order History or the customer indicates the meter was turned off, do not schedule the order for an all-day appointment. Call the Escalation team or a Team Leader to have the account fixed.

> Note: There is no limit to the number of accounts that can be handled on a call. It is the goal to resolve all customer inquiries during the first contact. However, if the customer has six or more [Turn On](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/OleV2-Index.aspx?guid=fedc1c66-d29c-4f51-b3b7-9a8d93d941ff&pn=Start%20Service) or [Turn Off](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Turn%20Off.aspx) requests, advise the customer that the process time for the requests will be lengthy. Offer the option of using the company's website or e-mail. Refer to [Handle Multiple Accounts](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Handle-Multiple-Accounts.aspx).

## Turn On Frequently Asked Questions

### Can a Turn On request be created by anyone other than customer of record?

No. Only customer of record or related contract customer (Y, Y) can request a Turn On. Refer to [Customer Confidentiality](https://ole.wecenergygroup.com/sites/OLE/OLEV2/Pages/Customer-Confidentiality.aspx).

### Can an owner agreement be set up by information provided by the tenant?

No. Owner agreements must be set up directly with the owner or landlord.

### If a customer record exists but the customer is requesting service for a different utility, can the same record be used?

No. A new customer record must be created as part of the Turn On.

Examples:

- Customer record exists for WPS and customer is requesting service for UMERC (WPS), and vice versa.
- Customer record exists for NSG and customer is requesting service for PGL, and vice versa.
- Customer record exists for MERC and customer is requesting service for MGU, and vice versa.
- Customer record exists for UMERC (WE) and customer is requesting service for UMERC (WPS), and vice versa.
- Customer record exists for WE and customer is requesting service for WPS, and vice versa.

When the new customer record is created, enter a comment indicating the utility for which the record was created in the Alert attribute field.

> Example: "CUST # for UMERC accounts."

### Do technicians carry ladders to light overhead and/or rooftop heating units?

- Technicians will check rooftop or attic units if there is a safe foldout staircase or built-in stairwell.
- Some technicians have 6-foot ladders to access overhead appliances.
- If a customer needs a technician with a 10-foot ladder, which is the limit, a limited crew with these ladders can make the stop if known in advance.
- For any other circumstances, meet the customer's contractor or maintenance person and provide gas while they light or check appliances.
- NSG only: The company has some 20-foot extension ladders and technicians occasionally go on some roofs based on a mutual decision between the technician and supervisor.
    - NSG does not recommend this option.
    - A technician shall not lean an extension ladder against a hanging unit when the hanging unit is the only support for the upper half of the ladder.
    - A technician shall not use an extension ladder alone. Another employee is required at the base of the ladder to hold and steady it.
